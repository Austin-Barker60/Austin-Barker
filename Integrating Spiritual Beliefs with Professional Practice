Principle 1: The glory of God is intelligence, or in other words, light and truth. Doctrine and Covenants 93:36. Seek learning.
Principle 2: … see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order. Mosiah 4:27. Be diligent but do not overdo it. 
Principle 3: Be Honest with God and my fellow man.
