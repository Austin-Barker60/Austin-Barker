Principle 1: The glory of God is intelligence, or in other words, light and truth. Doctrine and Covenants 93:36. 

This means that I need to be always learning, whether that is spiritual or technical. To better follow this principle, I have 
dedicated some time each day to my personal learning. I will either review or learn new skills. 

Principle 2: … see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. 
And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order. Mosiah 4:27.

I need to do things in order and have order in all aspects of my life. I need to learn my limits and not overdo it, but I need to 
be diligent in my work and do all I can. 

Principle 3: Be Honest with God and my fellow man. 
I feel this is straightforward; I need to be honest in all things. If I make a mistake, I need to own up to it. 
If I see something wrong, I need to say something. If someone else did something, they need the credit.
