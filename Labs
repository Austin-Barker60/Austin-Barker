Cyber Lab Migration
OVERVIEW
Description
Project Background

Ensign College’s cybersecurity program currently relies on an on-premises cyber lab for hands-on exercises. 
This lab uses a Proxmox virtualization server protected by a Palo Alto firewall/VPN, enabling students to connect to
virtual machines (e.g., Kali Linux attacker VMs, vulnerable servers, and monitoring systems) for penetration testing 
and defensive exercises. While effective, this setup has limitations:

Scalability: Physical hardware restricts capacity.

Remote Access: VPN-based access is cumbersome for remote learners.

Maintenance: Hardware and network upkeep are resource-intensive.

Opportunity

Migrating the lab to AWS will create a scalable, flexible, and modern environment that aligns with industry 
best practices. Benefits include:

On-demand provisioning of isolated Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for students/teams.

Pre-configured virtual machines and cloud desktops.

Support for red-team (offense) and blue-team (defense) activities in a secure sandbox.

Exposure to cloud security skills, enhancing curriculum relevance.

Project Description

Key Design Elements:

Isolated AWS VPC: Subnets for attacker, target, and defender systems; routing and security groups mimicking 
on-prem firewall rules.

Virtual Machines (EC2): Kali Linux attacker VM, vulnerable targets (e.g., Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop), 
and SOC/defender VM.

Student Access: Options include Amazon WorkSpaces for cloud desktops or a bastion host for SSH/RDP.

Networking & Security: AWS Security Groups, Network ACLs, and possibly AWS Network Firewall or Client VPN.

Integration & IAM: Proof-of-concept integration with LMS tools and role-based access control.

Student will follow cloud security best practices and implement cost-saving measures (e.g., scheduled instance shutdowns).

Summary
Objectives
Replicate On-Prem Lab in AWS with equivalent or enhanced functionality.
Support Course Outcomes: Enable secure network design, ethical hacking, and monitoring exercises.
Pilot Initial Course (e.g., IT 125) using the AWS lab.
Create Documentation & Diagrams comparing legacy vs. cloud architecture.
Identify Challenges & Mitigations: Address security, cost, and onboarding issues.
Enhance Student Experience: Simplify access and enable remote participation.

Key Deliverables: Provide a list of the key deliverables that the team should provide by the end of the project. 
Include completed activities, recommendation, and tools/resources developed during the project.
Expected Deliverables
• Functional AWS Lab Environment for at least one course.
• Architecture Diagrams: Current vs. cloud setup.
• Setup Documentation: VPC configs, instance details, automation scripts.
• User Guide: Access instructions and troubleshooting tips.
• Test Results & Feedback: Summary of trial exercises and observations.
• Recommendations Report: Roadmap for full migration, including course priorities, cost estimates, 
and instructor training needs.
Impact
This project will modernize Ensign College’s cybersecurity program, providing students with real-world cloud 
security experience, improving accessibility, and reducing infrastructure constraints. The pilot will serve as a
foundation for an 18-month full migration plan, positioning the program at the forefront of cybersecurity education.
The student will give an honest account of their time usage each week to the project sponsor - please only log 
hours that are actually spent working on the project.
The student will attend a bi-weekly course design meeting during the day in the United States. This is a mandatory
meeting both times. If there are conflicts with your work or school schedule, then unfortunately you won’t be able 
to participate in the project.
The student will work independently with minimal supervision and will be expected to work without step-by-step 
instructions.
