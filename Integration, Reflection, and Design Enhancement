****Integrating Christlike Attributes and Addressing Personal Warning Signs****

As I work on my Portfolio, I am coming to understand how my career field and spiritual growth are tied. This portfolio represents what I have learned from school and the kind of person I want to become. A Christ-like attribute that I want to focus on
is integrity, and I have recognized that I need to be aware of personal warning signs, such as burnout and losing motivation. 

Practicing integrity is an important Christ-like attribute for me, both in my personal life and in my career field. When making this, I got held up with other school assignments and worked a 9-hour hard shift at work. Exhausted, I pushed on. And asked AI to help me. 
Reading the AI's version is much clearer and more profound than what I am putting down, but these are my own, tired words. In a world where people constantly take the easy way out and pass off others' work as their own, we who enter the IT field need to be honest. 
As I am writing this, I am burntout and losing motivation. I am well aware of strategies to help prevent these, but every time I try them, they just make things worse. I don't know how I manage my time better, other than by telling myself, "No more rest." 

****Usability Testing And Enhancement Report****
I was not aware of this testing. But I can see how my GitHub repository isn't the best for first-time visitors. I will strive to make it look better and more organized.
